Most recently focused on backend dev/data engineering of enterprise-level fintech ETL and data-integration pipelines for multi-sourced, multi-tenant portfolio risk evaluation and monitoring system. I also have quite a bit of prior full-stack dev experience.

Currently seeking new employment opportunities.
